# CS154 Projects
This repository has three projects from the class CS 154: Introduction to Computer Systems. All were done in C and completed in Fall 2019.

A note: Most files within these folders were part of what was given in the project, meaning I did not create them.
The files that I changed are as follows:

1. p1bitmanip: bits.c
2. p3cache: csim.c
3. p4shell: myshell.c

Note: These will not run and may not make total sense, as I have removed some code in order to prevent it from being plagiarized by following cohorts of CS 154.
